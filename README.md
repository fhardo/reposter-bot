## Reposter
A discord bot for reacting to messages containing certain text in certain channels, and then prompting certain users whether or not they want to repost those messages to other channels.

Specifically the use case for this is for our homebrew app store refreshing discord bot, which outputs the results of what homebrews have been updated on the server. After that message is sent, this Reposter bot reacts to the message with some emojis which admins can click on to tell reposter to carry that message across to the #hbas-repo channel or the 4tu twitter.

To configure, edit `config.json` with the appropriate values.
